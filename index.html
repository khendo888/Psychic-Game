	<!--the object of the game is for the user to guess what letter the computer was thinking of.
	When the browser opens, the title of the game "The Psychic Game" appears, along with a message that says "Can you guess the letter I'm thinking of?" 
	Each time a letter is pressed, the computer will display the letter. if the letter pressed matches what the computer was thinking before the choices run out, the user wins. Otherwise the user loses.
